# Lasting Impressions

This ExpressionEngine module will record the entries viewed by each visitor to your site.

You can then re-display each visitor's entries to them using all the same functionality as the standard ExpressionEngine channel:entries tag pair.

This module was originally designed for ecommerce sites to display a "recently viewed products" list to each customer, however it can be used anywhere you need to record and "playback" entries seen by each visitor to your site.
You can track entries from any or all channels and then specify which channel you are interested in when playing them back.

The entries are stored in a cookie for each visitor to your site.
This add-on logs of the dates, times and number of views of each tracked entry which you can re-display to your visitors or use in reports by downloading the data from the EECMS control panel.

The full use guide can be found here:

##Upgrading templates from version 2

If you are upgrading a site from EE2 to EE3 your Lasting Impressions tags will need a minor adjustment. The old EE2 tags:

```

... will need to be replaced with

```
{exp:lasting_impressions:xxx}
```
